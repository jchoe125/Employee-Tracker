## Description

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. This application utilizes Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL in order to allow the user to manage a company's employee database.


## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am presented with the following options: view all departments, view all roles, view all employees, add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee role
WHEN I choose to view all departments
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids
WHEN I choose to view all roles
THEN I am presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role
WHEN I choose to view all employees
THEN I am presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to
WHEN I choose to add a department
THEN I am prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add a role
THEN I am prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role and that role is added to the database
WHEN I choose to add an employee
THEN I am prompted to enter the employeeâ€™s first name, last name, role, and manager, and that employee is added to the database
WHEN I choose to update an employee role
THEN I am prompted to select an employee to update and their new role and this information is updated in the database 
```

Additionally, the application will feature the use of the NPM packages listed below:
* [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).
* [MySQL2 package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) to connect to a MySQL database.
* [console.table package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console.

## Installation

The user must perform an npm install to install all required dependencies prior to running the application. Once complete, the user can start the app by running `node.js` from the CLI, which will start the sequence of prompts to build out the database.
